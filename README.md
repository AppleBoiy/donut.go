# The Donut.go

I bet you're familiar with donuts, right? Just a donut, why so serious?     
It's as if everyone has their own donut.c, but I'm here in Go, spicing things up with my little spaghetti code.

# Let's Get Rolling!

```bash
go run donut.go
```

Roll away and enjoy the code magic! üç©‚ú®
